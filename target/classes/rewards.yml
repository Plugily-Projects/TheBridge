#             thebridge rewards configuration
#
#                    Placeholders list:
#             %PLAYER% - Current player name
#             %MAPNAME% - Name of map
#             %ARENA-ID% - Arena Identifier
#             %PLAYERAMOUNT% - Number of players in game
#
#        Commands are executed by default BY CONSOLE, use "p:" to preform command by player
#  You can use chance to execute command adding "chance(NUMBER):" (ex chance(10):) at the beginning of command
#
#  Commands examples:
#    - p:say Hello everyone in %MAPNAME%!     # Player will say "Hello everyone in <map name here>"
#    - broadcast Game %ARENA-ID% has ended!   # Will broadcast "Game <arena name here> has ended" message
#    - chance(1):p:say I was very lucky!              # Player has 1% chance to say "I was very lucky!"
#    - p:chance(99):spawn                             # Player has 99% chance to teleport to spawn
#       ^ YOU CAN EVEN SWAP CHANCE WITH PLAYER!
#    - chance(50):eco give %PLAYER% 10                # Console has 10% chance to give player 10$
#
#   You can unlock full potential of rewards using our script engine!
#    Just add example reward:
#    - script:player.sendMessage("oh, hi %PLAYER%");      # It will send "oh, hi <player name>" to player! 100% plain java!
#    - script:server.broadcastMessage("hello everyone");  # Broadcasts "hello everyone" to whole server
#    - script:player.getInventory().addItem(new org.bukkit.inventory.ItemStack(org.bukkit.Material.DIRT));
#         ^ Gives player dirt item (you must always use direct package names for not provided objects)
#
#                               All script provided objects:
#            player - Player object (API methods https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/Player.html)
#            server - Bukkit server object (API methods https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Server.html)
